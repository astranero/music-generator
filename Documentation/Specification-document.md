I have knowledge of the mighty Python Programming language
Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (Tietojenk√§sittelytieteen kandidaatti TKT)

## Introduction

My project aims to generate music using a MIDI dataset. The process involves:

- Parsing the contents of MIDI files
- Content would be notes and possibly frequencies
- Inputting them into a Markov Chain
- Storing notes and their frequencies in a Trie structure
- Retrieving the proceeding notes of a given note
- Using the Markov Chain algorithm to generate new music based on the patterns in the notes stored in the Trie.
- Time and space complexity objective would be O(n) with Trie data structure

## Tools and Libraries

- Python programming language
- `mido`, `midiutil`, `pretty_midi`, `midi2audio` or `fluidsynth` for working with MIDI files and soundfonts
- `click` for the user interface.

## User Interface

The user interface will have the following features:

- The ability to generate a MIDI file
- The ability to play the generated MIDI file
