# Weekly Report

## First Week Report (Hours 8h)

- [x] Project creation and setting up version control (GitHub)
- [x] Added issues to GitHub
- [x] Selected project topic
- [x] Conducted research on subject matter needed for the project
- [x] Read Introduction materials

### Problems

- Uncertainty on how to implement a Trie structure with Markov Chain
- Lack of musical knowledge making it difficult to understand what variables should be stored

### What I have Learned

- Markov Chains
- Basics of trie, but still need to understand it in more depth.
- Little bit about Midi files

### Questions

- Should the prediction of note numbers be enough or should velocity for a given note also be predicted using a Markov Chain?
- I think it might be fun to try using Markov Chain, so that each note will be linked to set of velocities, or some other randomization for selection of velocity.
- Is it acceptable for velocity and duration to be hard-coded?
- Any tips regarding this project would be appreciated.

### Next Week

- Focus on coding, including the creation of classes for MIDI handling and playing MIDI files
- Development of User Interface (UI)

## Week 2 Report (Hours 20)

- [x] Create and test basic Markov Chain
- [x] Create and test Trie Data Structure
- [x] Create midi player
- [x] Conducted more research on the project subject
- [x] Fix errors
- [x] Add pylint and other configurations

### Problems

- Had some problem with infinite loop while creating long chains of notes straight from generate_melody method.
So I had to do it from midi handler

### What I have Learned

- Its possible to use second degree Markov chain for this project
- Usage of mido library

### Questions

- I am wondering if I should implement second degree markov chain?

### Next Week

- Sound of generated mav sounds awful, so may be creating trying to make it sound good.
- I still haven't created UI, so that should be next priority.

## Week 3 Report (Hours 15)

- [x] Fix and refactor code
- [x] Trying different codes snippets and their affect on the sound
- [x] Fix errors related to the changes in the code
- [x] Add coverage report

### Problems

- Didn't have any problems this week, because everything was basically same as previous week. Just went through different ways of doing the same.

### What I have Learned

- I have learned that it's possible to do Markov Chain with recursion too, but still at the end it was easier with while loop.

### Questions

- None

### Next Week

- Now that my music sounds good I should do more test to be sure that data isn't being used too much. But before that I will create UI and also test MarkovPlayer class.

## Week 4 Report (Hours 12)

- [x] Create UI and refactor it
- [x] Write test documentation and implementation documentation
- [x] Fix errors

### Problems

- Didn't have any problems this week, because everything was basically same as previous week. Just went through different ways of doing the same.

### What I have Learned

- I have learned a way to test the Markov Chain better, but haven't implemented it

### Questions

- None

### Next Week

- I will improve Markov chain tests and also finnish documentation.

## Week 5 Report (Hours 10)

- [x] Refactor the code based on the reviews given.
- [x] Create a bash script for synching two different git branches and pushing them.
- [x] Write an issue
- [x] Improvement of UI, adding functionality to change music file.

### Problems

- Didn't have any problems this week, because everything was basically same as previous week. Just went through different ways of doing the same.

### What I have Learned

- This week for my own amusement I learned how to syncronize two different GitHub branches with bash scripting.

### Questions

- None

### Next Week

- I still haven't finished documentation, so that seems to be only thing left to do. One more test may be with bigger data too to check that generated data is unique. Just realised that my refactoring caused error in Markov Chain, so have to fix that.

## Week 6 Report (Hours 12)

- [x] Test that given a data unique melody is generated by Markov Chain.
- [x] Write an issue

### Problems

- I did create a test for checking if given a data unique melody is generated. But I am not 100% sure if I did it in a correct way.
How can I be more sure?

### What I have Learned

- I didn't learn much, because project is done.

### Questions

- None

### Next Week

- Not sure, there isn't anything to do.
