# Weekly Report

## First Week Report (Hours 8h)

- [x] Project creation and setting up version control (GitHub)
- [x] Added issues to GitHub
- [x] Selected project topic
- [x] Conducted research on subject matter needed for the project
- [x] Read Introduction materials

### Problems

- Uncertainty on how to implement a Trie structure with Markov Chain
- Lack of musical knowledge making it difficult to understand what variables should be stored

### What I have Learned

- Markov Chains
- Basics of trie, but still need to understand it in more depth.
- Little bit about Midi files

### Questions

- Should the prediction of note numbers be enough or should velocity for a given note also be predicted using a Markov Chain?
- I think it might be fun to try using Markov Chain, so that each note will be linked to set of velocities, or some other randomization for selection of velocity.
- Is it acceptable for velocity and duration to be hard-coded?
- Any tips regarding this project would be appreciated.

### Next Week

- Focus on coding, including the creation of classes for MIDI handling and playing MIDI files
- Development of User Interface (UI)
